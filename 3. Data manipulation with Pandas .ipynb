    "# Summary of the Lecture on pandas and DataFrames\n",
    "Introduction to pandas – pandas is a Python package for data manipulation and visualization, built on top of NumPy and Matplotlib. It is widely used in the data science community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Course Overview – The course covers DataFrames, data aggregation, slicing/indexing, data visualization, handling missing data, and reading data into DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding DataFrames – pandas is designed for working with rectangular/tabular data, where each row represents an observation and each column represents a variable. Similar concepts exist in R (DataFrames) and SQL (tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring a DataFrame –\n",
    "\n",
    ".head() – Displays the first few rows of a dataset.\n",
    "print(dongs.head())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".info() – Shows column names, data types, and missing values.\n",
    "print(dogs.info())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".shape – Provides the number of rows and columns as a tuple.\n",
    "print(dogs.shape())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".describe() – Computes summary statistics for numeric columns.\n",
    "print(doga.describe())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame Components –\n",
    "\n",
    ".values – Contains the data in a 2D NumPy array.\n",
    "print(dogs.values)\n",
    "\n",
    ".columns – Stores column names.\n",
    "print(dogs.columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".index – Stores row labels or numbers.\n",
    "print(dogs.index)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas Philosophy – Unlike Python’s \"Zen of Python,\" which suggests one obvious way to solve a problem, pandas offers multiple approaches, making it flexible but sometimes harder to learn. The course focuses on essential methods for efficiency.\n",

    "New columns can be derived from existing ones for better analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adding a New Column\n",
    "Also known as mutating, transforming, or feature engineering.\n",
    "Use DataFrame[\"new_column\"] = calculation to create a new column.\n",
    "Example (Netflix Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a new column for movie duration in hours (from minutes)\n",
    "netflix[\"duration_hours\"] = netflix[\"duration\"] / 60\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculating a Metric (Doggy BMI Example)\n",
    "New columns can be created using multiple existing columns.\n",
    "Formula: BMI = weight_kg / (height_m ** 2).\n",
    "Example (Netflix Dataset - IMDb Score Adjustment)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a normalized IMDb rating (scaled between 0 and 1)\n",
    "netflix[\"normalized_rating\"] = netflix[\"imdb_rating\"] / 10\n",

    "4. Combining Multiple Operations\n",
    "pandas becomes powerful when multiple operations are combined.\n",
    "Example: Find popular, long movies by subsetting, sorting, and selecting relevant columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finding Netflix movies with IMDb rating > 8, sorting by duration, and selecting columns\n",
    "popular_movies = netflix[netflix[\"imdb_rating\"] > 8].sort_values(\"duration\", ascending=False)[[\"title\", \"duration\", \"imdb_rating\"]]\n",
